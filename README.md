# How to run

- Use your package manager to install the packages

```
npm/pnpm/yarn install
```

then run the dev script to run the project locally

```
npm/pnpm run dev
```

## Brief context

Project uses Context API from React and useDispatch as state management.
for persist data I decide to use localstorage and mock some data into the code to avoid BE or extra development.

I also decide to use some libraries like talwind to make the styling proccess faster
